# COVID-19-Forecasting

<br>


## Introduction
<br>

This project focuses on time series Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to examine global COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. By visualizing temporal patterns, identifying growth phases, and comparing trends across different regions, the analysis provides a deeper understanding of how the virus spread over time. Special attention is given to detecting hotspots, analyzing growth rates, and exploring features that significantly influenced the trajectory of the pandemic.
