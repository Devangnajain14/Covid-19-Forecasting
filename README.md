# COVID-19-Forecasting

<br>


## Introduction
<br>

This is a project to potentially help discover the patterns of the Coronavirus spread and important features that affects the spread. 

The **techniques** I am planning to use for forecasting are: <br>
* ARIMA 
* Seq2Seq + LSTM (Deep Learning)
* Xgboost (Machine Learning)
<br>
